object oriented block device driver

finalize sdcc peephole rules

O_NONBLOCK returns file in error state
SIGINT can be enabled in key scan like CTRL-C in cpm target


bad int state code in clg() -classic c lib (wos, einar)
sections done wrong


method to use different tty terminals at target using -lcpm/vt100 (eg)



copt limit on matching string length
memstream attached to fd


TODO:

[

* text mode open on memstreams

* do we really need two sets of input/output primitives for stdio

* known issue: input terminals immediately repeat key on caps/lower transition

* known issue: fzx justify functions need to distribute remainder spacing evenly

* known issue: in password mode output terminals display '*' when enter typed

* zx scroll reexamined

* change 4x8 font to use only nibbles in font definitions


MEDIUM TERM:

* add library options to opt in/out of ioctls

* make some library options compile time rather than library build time

* low level fzx print functions with embedded control sequences


LONG TERM:

* all struct offsets in asm code should be defined in a DEFVARS block



LONG TERM TENTATIVE:

* pattern filler
  add shaped fill

* output terminal
  add inverse, underline, italic, xor, or

sccz80 deficiency:

// mutiple function definitions with same return type
// int fa(int), fb(int);

// static initialization of double
// double c = 1.0;

// backslash escape that isn't followed by lf
//int a[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, \ 
//1, 1, 1, 1,  /* comment */
//2, 2, 2, 2};
